Here is a major part of your work, here you will design the looks of your race.
I've included all the basics of the human body from the vanilla game as an example.

NOTE: If your species does not fit the basic human body shape, get ready to create a massive amount of armors and work arounds.
from experiance, I can certify you that the less it looks like a human, the more the game assets will look weird on your character,
my pony modpack is probably the most extreme example of what can happen if you throw the human shape by the window.


Here is what each files is used for:
