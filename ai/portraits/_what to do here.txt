These are the images used when your ai is talking to the player and appears over the chat area, we call these portraits.

When renaming files please make sure that the name of the files follow these templates:
   Ai Portrait: <YourRaceId>aiportrait.png
Quest portrait: <YourRaceId>questportrait.png

Where:
  <YourRaceId> is the "kind" value you assigned to your species in your .species file.
