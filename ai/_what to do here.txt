NOTE: The naming convention here is a bit different from the rest of the assets, blame the devs.

These are the images used in the ai console on your ships.

When renaming files please make sure that the name of the files follow these templates:
  frames: <YourRaceId>aiportrait.frames
portrait: <YourRaceId>questportrait.png
  static: static<YourRaceId>.png

Where:
  <YourRaceId> is the "kind" value you assigned to your species in your .species file,
    in all of the cases here, the value race name must start with a capital letter, for example:
    pixelraceAI.png, pixelraceAI.frames, staticpixelrace.png
